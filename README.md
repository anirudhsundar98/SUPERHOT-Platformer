# SlowTime Game 
A test platformer modelled off the main mechanic in the game `SuperHot`.

## Instructions
* Use arrow keys to move (`Up Arrow` to jump).  
* Use `X` to attack. You'll be attacking in the last direction you faced/moved in.  
* Time slows down when you are not pressing any of the directional keys.
